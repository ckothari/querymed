Setting up the server
======================

The instructions at http://www.devworld.apple.com/internet/java/tomcat1.html is for Tomcat 4, but the latest is Tomcat 6.
(And that's what I have installed)
Some of the instructions given in that link are obsolete. Here's the configuration set up for the context:
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/context.html

More specific information can be found after installing the server can be found at:

Structure of the source repo
=============================

	1.	ui - place for all the JSP, HTML, JavaScripts and Stylesheets
	2.	src - place for the java class files consisting of POJOÕs or servlets.
	3.	etc - place for all config files like the most common web.xml
	4.	lib - place for all the necessary jar files to run the application. I even have included servlet-api.jar in this directory since you may have to deploy your web application in a remote server after compiling.
	5.	build - a temporary directory for keeping the compiled files
	6.	dist - a place to put in the finally packaged war file (distribution)
	7.	ant- place for my build.xml file and external properties file
